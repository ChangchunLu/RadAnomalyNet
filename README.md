# Deep Learning-Based Anomaly Detection for Advanced Signal Processing in Radiation Imaging

## Overview

Anomaly detection in radiation imaging is a critical task for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of advanced signal processing systems used in various applications, including medical diagnostics, industrial monitoring, and environmental sensing. Radiation imaging systems often deal with complex and high-dimensional data, making the task of detecting rare and subtle anomalies highly challenging. The goal of this project is to introduce an effective deep learning framework, **Attention-Based Probabilistic Anomaly Detection Network (APAD-Net)**, that addresses these challenges through advanced techniques such as multi-scale feature extraction, attention mechanisms, and probabilistic modeling.

APAD-Net integrates attention mechanisms to dynamically assign weights to different features based on their relevance for anomaly detection, improving the model's ability to focus on the most informative parts of the data. Furthermore, the model utilizes Gaussian-based likelihood modeling to provide an interpretable and probabilistic measure of how well each data point fits the normal data distribution, ensuring more reliable anomaly scoring and decision-making.

The key contribution of this study is the introduction of **Adaptive Anomaly Optimization Strategy (AAOS)**, which enhances training and generalization capabilities. AAOS includes dynamic data augmentation, adaptive thresholding, and a feedback-driven refinement loop that iteratively improves the modelâ€™s performance. This strategy ensures that APAD-Net can handle the inherent variability and complexity of radiation imaging data while maintaining high detection accuracy.
